    Welcome to the Plant Recognition System! üåøüîç
    
    Our mission is to help in identifying plant names efficiently. Upload an image of a leaf of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect from which plant this leaf belongs to. Together, let's detect different plants and ensure a fruitful outcome!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Plant Recognition** page and upload an image of a leaf of any plant.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential name of the plant which it belongs to.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Plant Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Plant Recognition System!

    ### About Us

                #### About Dataset
                This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset.The original dataset can be found on this github repo.
                This dataset consists of about 9K rgb images of different plant leaves which is categorized into 6 different classes.The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure.
                A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.
                #### Content
                1. train (6500 images)
                2. test (33 images)
                3. validation (1620 images)
