# Medicinal Plant Classification- AI Course Project

This is AI course semester project offered during 3rd Semester at IIT Dharwad.It was a group Project done by total 6 peoples.This project aims to classify different types of plants using deep learning techniques focusing CNN.

---

## Introduction

Plant classification is an important task in agriculture, botany, and environmental science. This project utilizes deep learning to automatically classify images of plants into different species or categories.

## Tech Stack Used:

- Tensorflow, Keras (for building CNN model)
- Streamlit (for frontend)
- numpy, pandas (for data processing)
- matplotlib, seaborn (for data visualization)

## Usage

To use the plant classification model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: <br>
- git clone https://github.com/hackerpranavpandey/AI-Course-Semester-Project.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
- cd AIProject
3. Install the dependencies:
- pip install streamlit -q
- wget -q -O - ipv4.icanhazip.com
4. Run the application: 
- streamlit run ./main.py &
- npx localtunnel --port 8501
5. Upload an image on the website and get the result!
